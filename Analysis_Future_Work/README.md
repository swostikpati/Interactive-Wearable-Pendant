# Analysis 

The "Design Framework for Social Wearables" provides an insightful approach to evaluating wearable technology not just in terms of technology but also its social implications and acceptability. My project, involving a wearable pendant that uses a temperature sensor and a neopixel ring, fits within this framework, particularly when analyzed as a social wearable.

The pendant is designed to be worn by individuals, with the neopixel ring emitting light patterns that correlate to the wearer's emotional state as interpreted through temperature changes. This aligns with the framework's emphasis on sensing (through the temperature sensor) and actuating (via the light patterns). The interaction between these two elements - sensing and actuating - plays a pivotal role in how the device functions as a social wearable.

In terms of social acceptability, the project stands out for its unobtrusive design and engaging visual output. The use of familiar technology in a pendant form factor is likely to be perceived as non-threatening and could even be a conversation starter, thereby enhancing its acceptability in social settings. The light patterns, which serve as a non-verbal form of communication about the wearer's emotional state, add an intriguing layer to social interactions. This could encourage new forms of expression and engagement in social contexts.

This also brings forth considerations regarding personal and social requirements. The pendant must be designed in a way that is comfortable and appealing for the wearer, while also ensuring that the light patterns are not intrusive or overwhelming in social settings. Balancing these aspects is crucial to ensure that the wearable is not only technologically sound but also socially harmonious.

My project, as a social wearable, not only incorporates important technological aspects but also carefully considers its impact and role in a social context. It embodies a fusion of personal expression and social interaction, fitting well within the framework's guidelines for social wearables.
